# sudoku_30_minutes by AngorROOT

sudoku_30_minutes is a project that consists of an ASCII sudoku game from the terminal with a lot of customization. It has the ability to create new and different boards and save the games if desired, as well as solve any sudoku using the backtracking method implemented in the last release if the keyword "el pueblo pide awa" is entered.

## Description

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

sudoku_30_minutes is a Python project that allows you to play sudoku from the terminal, using ASCII characters to represent the board and the numbers. You can choose from three difficulty levels: easy, medium or hard. You can save your progress and resume it later, or start a new game at any time. You can also check if your solution is correct or ask for a hint if you are stuck. If you want to see how the backtracking algorithm works, you can enter the keyword "el pueblo pide awa" and watch how the script solves the sudoku for you.

## Installation

To install the project, you need to have Python 3.11 installed on your system. You do not need any library or installation other than Python itself. The steps are as follows:
